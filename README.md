<h3> About me :smiley:</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a Javascript and Ruby On Rails full-stack developer. I have, completed an international remote full-stack development program that focuses on real-world projects and pair programming, that is called Microverse. It was a 8+ months in an amazing journey where I learned so many things and built some aplications from scratch that I would never imagine I would be able to do it. In addition to learning how to program at a fast pace, I also have improved my communication and teamwork skills. I really enjoyed working with different people from all around the world, I've already made some friends.</p>

  <summary>more about my journey </summary>
  <br>
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  At the end of my first month, in only 4 days I created a landing page with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML that fulfilled the design guidelines across many devices, and I’m very proud of it. <a href="https://tiagomarin.github.io/Eagle-English/">(here is the link to it)</a> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Before that, I was working as a Coordinator of English teachers, which gave me experience with training and leading. I've always liked technology, and at some point I realized how fast people that work with tech develop themselves. That's when I decided I'd jump in this path. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  I’m really looking forward to working with a strong tech team because I want to be involved with people who have a growth mindset like me. I am quite driven, and my long-term goal is to work as a lead developer in a large, multinational company and potentially serve as a CTO. As for today, I am looking for an opportunity to shine as an immediate contributor to a full-stack development team.
