<h2> Hi there :smiley:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, I am participating in an international remote full-stack development program that focuses on real-world projects and pair programming, that is called Microverse. In addition to learning how to program at a fast pace, I also have improved my communication and teamwork skills.  At the end of my first month, in only 4 days I created a landing page with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML that fulfilled the design guidelines across many devices, and I’m very proud of it. ( ![here is the link to it](https://github.com/Tiago-Lelinski-Marin/Eagle-English) )</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I previously worked as a Coordinator of English teachers, which gave me experience with training and leading. I’m really looking forward to working with a strong tech team because I want to be involved with people who have a growth mindset like me. I am quite driven, and my long-term goal is to work as a lead developer in a large, multinational company and potentially serve as a CTO. As for today, I am looking for an opportunity to shine as an immediate contributor to a full-stack development team.</p>
